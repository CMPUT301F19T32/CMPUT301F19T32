Code: The main code is in Part4 folder.
The PNG file of storyboard is unclear, click on Down to down a clear pdf storyboard.

Remind:
APP wokrs properly for API29 AND API28. In API27, it may generate some error message in event log of android studio, but does not affect its function.
The location function uses Android Object <Geocoder>, if the device does not support this service, app cannot use location function.
(android java.io.IOException: Service not Available) for this error
For most android devices, especially real devices, they have this service. 
Another reason is that (java.io.IOException: grpc failed). for this case, it may caused by Geocoder failed when latitude and longitude 
contain above 3 decimal places, or it may be said that Geocoder can not decode every latitude and longitude.
(app may not work properly during this case. Since when we are doing testing, it's hard to find a device that 
does not have Geocoder service, and even we choose latitude and longitude contain above 3 decimal places for testing, app works properly.)
