# Project Introduction
To assist in understanding the emotional states and triggers of individuals and groups, we want a mobile application that allows one to post, track, and share their moods.
For university students or staff that participate in using the app, this could allow a clearer picture of their experiences, perceptions, and mental well-being in the face of challenges in academic life.
